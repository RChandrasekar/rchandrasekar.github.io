### Raman "Chandra" Chandrasekar

I have a background in research as well as engineering management, with a focus on addressing real-world problems 
in language, search, and learning. I have experience incubating and 
deploying applications in areas such as web-scale search, text mining, topical news dissemination and context extraction.

I got my PhD in machine translation from the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR), Bombay, and worked there 
and at the National Centre for Software Technology, Mumbai. Later, I was at 
the Institute for Research in Cognitive Science, University of Pennsylvania, continuing my work on automatic sentence simplification, 
and using natural language processing to improve search. From 1998 to 2010, I was at Microsoft and Microsoft Research, (Redmond + Beijing), 
working on search, text mining, news dissemination, human computation, and related areas. Later, I worked at a news-dissemination startup, Evri.com, 
and still later, managed the development of web-scale academic search products at ProQuest, Seattle. I then consulted, and taught at Northeastern University’s 
Seattle campus. I was Clinical Professor in the Khoury College at Northeastern’s Seattle campus till Sep. 2022.
I have since been at the Institute for Experiential AI at Northeastern.
